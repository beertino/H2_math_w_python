    "# 1. Functions – Rule, Domain and Range\n",
    "Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. A **function** $f$ from $X$ to $Y$, denoted as $f:X\\rightarrow Y$, is a mapping (think of this as a way to associate or relate or pair) of *each element* of the set $X$ to exactly one of the elements of the set $Y$. To denote elements $x$ and $y$ are paired, we write $x\\mapsto y$. Furthermore, if the element $x$ in $X$ is mapped to the element $y$ in $Y$ by the function $f$, we write $f(x)=y$, and we say that $y$ is the **image of $x$ under $f$**. Besides a way of association, with this definition, we can think of a function $f$ of some kind of machine that accepts an input $x\\in X$ and gives an output $y\\in Y$. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Note:\n",
    ">- *each element* means that every element in $X$ has to be associated to some element in $Y$. However, not every element in $Y$ has to be associated with.\n",
    ">- *exactly one* means that a function is single-valued. It will not give more than one output for the same input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "Let $X=\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $Y=\\{ 3,5,7,9\\}$. \n",
    "- **(a)** Let $f$ be a way of relating the elements $1,2,3,4$ in $X$ with the elements in $5,3,7,9$ in $Y$ respectively. We write:\n",
    "    - $1 \\mapsto 5$, $2 \\mapsto 3$, $3 \\mapsto 7$, $4 \\mapsto 9$\n",
    "    - $f$ is a function because it fulfills the definition above. \n",
    "- **(b)** Let $g$ be a way of relating the elements $1,2,3,4$ in $X$ with the elements in $3,7,9,7$ in $Y$ respectively. We write:\n",
    "    - $1 \\mapsto 3$, $2 \\mapsto 7$, $3 \\mapsto 9$, $4 \\mapsto 7$\n",
    "    - $g$ is also a function because it fulfills the definition above. \n",
    "- **(c)** Let $h$ be a way of relating the elements $1,2,3,3$ in $X$ with the elements in $3,7,3,9$ in $Y$ respectively. We write:\n",
    "    - $1 \\mapsto 3$, $2 \\mapsto 7$, 3 is mapped twice to different elements in $Y$, $3 \\mapsto 3$, $3 \\mapsto 9$, and 4 isn't mapped to anything.\n",
    "    - $h$ is **NOT** a function because it violates 2 conditions in the definition above (See Note). \n",
    "\n",
    "For a function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$,:\n",
    "- the set $X$ is called the **domain of $f$**, denoted by $D_{f}$. \n",
    "- The set $Y$ is called the **codomain of $f$**, and\n",
    "- the *set of elements in the set $Y$ with at least one element $x$ in the set $X$ associated to it* is called the **range of $f$**, usually denoted by $R_{f}$. In other words, The range of $f$ is defined as the set of all the possible images of the elements of $X$ under the function $f$ i.e., $R_f =\\{f(x) : x\\in X\\}$.\n",
    "- It is quite obvious from the definition that the range $R_f$ is always a subset of the codomain of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "Referring back to Example 1\n",
    "- **(a)** $D_f=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, $R_f=\\{3,5,7,9\\}$ and $R_f$ is the same as the codomain of $f$.\n",

    "- **(c)** THe terms wouldn't make sense as the relation $h$ is not even a function. In our definition, the concepts of domain, codomain and range only makes sense if the relation is a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$, the precise description of the way to associate element $x\\in X$ with some element $y\\in Y$ is termed the **rule of $f$**. We have seen earlier that if $y$ and $x$ is associated as such, we write $f(x)=y$. Therefore, we can also take that $f(x)$ as the rule of the function $f$. And in A-Level, $f(x)$ is often an expression in the variable $x$. Also, if use the machine anology, we can think of domain of $f$ as the collection of all possible inputs of the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "With Python, given the domain and rule of $f$, we can use *list comprehension* to get the range of $f$! This is very nice, because this way of doing matches with how we mathematically define $R_f$.\n",

    "The graphical representation of a relation can also show when the relation is not a function. In example 1, we see the relation $h$, $1 \\mapsto 3$, $2 \\mapsto 7$, 3 is mapped twice to different elements in $Y$, $3 \\mapsto 3$, $3 \\mapsto 9$, and 4 isn't mapped to anything. Note in the following graph that there are 2 points ( $(3,3)$ and $(3,9)$) that has the same input value $x$. By definition of a function, such thing cannot happen (see earlier section). As such, $h$ cannot be a function."

    "# 6. Composite Functions\n",
    "So far, we have examined various examples of functions individually. A natural question that arises from this is as follow: Given two functions $f,g$, can we create a new function with them as constituents?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is YES, and one way to achieve it is by chaining the output of a function, say $g$, and using it as an input for the next function, say $f$. However, this approach will not always work and in this section, we will see the conditions when we can actually do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such expected behaviour is totally natural and frequently encountered. For a more concrete example, consider the following situation. We have a square with sides of length $x$ units. If we are to increase the side of the square by 2 units and then, scale the sides of the square by a factor of 3, what is the area of the resultant square?\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitive, we would have done the following in sequence \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x&\\mapsto x+2 \\\\ \n",
    "x+2&\\mapsto 3(x+2) \\\\\n",
    "3(x+2)&\\mapsto (3(x+2))^2.\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we think about it, we have $x\\mapsto (3(x+2))^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point this example try to illustrate is that we are taking outputs of a mapping to be used as an input of *another* mapping repeatedly (see line 2 and 3) and in the end, we can actually just condense the multiple mapping steps into only ONE map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such approach of creating a new function (by nesting a function inside another) is what we call **function composition**, and the resulting function is called a **composite function**. We will make the definition formal a little later\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Condition for Existence for Composite Functions\n",
    "In the example given in the previous section, it is indeed reasonable that such composite function would exist in the end. However, such procedure doesn't always necessarily produce a function in the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider $f:{1,2}\\mapsto 0$ and $g:{3,4}\\mapsto 1$. We see that\n",
    "1. if we start with $f$ first, then $1\\mapsto 0$ and $2\\mapsto 0$, but in both cases $0$ cannot be mapped by $g$ as $0$ doesn't exists in the domain of $g$.\n",
    "2. on the other hand, if we are to start with $g$ first, then $3\\mapsto 1$ and $4\\mapsto 1$, and since $1$ is inside the domain of $f$, we can continue further to have $$3\\mapsto 1\\mapsto 0, 4\\mapsto 1 \\mapsto 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: the input elements in this process to generate composite functions is always the elements in the domain of the first function being considered. In the above cases, it is $D_f$ and $D_g$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we can conclude that in order for the chaining of the values to be carried out successfully, the output of the first function must be able to be used as the input of the function that comes after. If $g,f$ is the first and second function respectively, symbolically, this means that $R_g$ must fall within $D_f$, i.e. $R_g\\subseteq D_f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to define a composite function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f:X_1\\rightarrow Y_1$ and $g:X_2 \\rightarrow Y_2$. The **composite function** $f\\circ g$ (note that this seemingly has 2 functions, but really just symbol used to represent a single SINGLE function) is a function such that \n",
    "1. $R_g \\subseteq D_f = X_1$. Note that $R_g$ is not necessarily $X_1$.\n",
    "2. $f\\circ g:X_2 \\rightarrow Y_1$. In particular, note that $D_{f\\circ g}=D_g$.\n",
    "3. for any $x\\in X$, $x\\mapsto  f(g(x))$. In other words, $f\\circ g (x) = f(g(x))$. Note that the RHS has TWO functions $f$ and $g$, while the LHS only has ONE function, $f\\circ g$.\n",

    "## 7.2 Finding the Rule of Inverse Functions\n",
    "Recall that in our dealing of function $f:X \\rightarrow Y$, we have $y=f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is just an expression in $x$. In other words, to get $y$, we need to operate on expressions in $x$. Now, if inverse functions reverse the mapping, the core idea is then to get $x$, we need to operate on expressions in $y$. As such, the logical thing to find the rule of the inverse function is to start with the original equation involving $y$ and $x$ where $y$ is the subject and manipulate them algebraically until $x$ becomes the subject instead. As such, we have the steps outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $f$ is the rule for a one-to-one function $f$. To find $f^{-1}(x)$, the rule of the inverse function of $f$, we apply the following steps.\n",
    "1. Let $y=f(x)$\n",
    "2. Make $x$ the subject of the equation, i.e. express $x$ in terms of $y$.  \n",
    "3. This expression in terms of $y$ is the rule of the $f^{1}$, i.e. it's the $f^{-1}(y)$.\n",
    "4. As it is customary for functions to use $x$ as input, we replace the occurences of $y$ with $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let $f:x\\mapsto 2x-2$, $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n",
    "- Explain why $f^{-1}$ exists.\n",
    "- Find the rule of $f^{-1}$.\n",
    "- Determine the domain of $f^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution*\n",
    "- It is straightforward to see that $f$ is a one-one function (left as an exercise for reader). As such, $f^{-1}$ must exist.\n",
    "- To determine the rule, following the steps above gives:\n",
    "    1. Let $y=2x-2$\n",
    "    2. Make $x$ the subject of the equation, $$x=\\frac{y+2}{2}.$$\n",
    "    3. Rule of $f^{-1}$: $f^{-1}(y)=\\frac{y+2}{2}$.\n",
    "    4. Replacing $y$ with $x$ in the rule in (3): $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{x+2}{2}$\n",
    "- $D_{f^{-1}}=R_f=\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, $f^{-1}:x\\mapsto \\frac{x+2}{2}$, $D_{f^{-1}}=R_f=\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will verify that $f^{-1}(x)$ defined above is indeed the inverse, by checking the composite functions $g(f(x))$ and $f(g(x))$ where $g(x)=\\frac{x+2}{2}$. Note that we are not writing as $f^{-1}$ because if we are checking, we can't assume that $g$ is already the inverse of $f$."
