    "# 1. Functions â€“ Rule, Domain and Range\n",
    "Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. A **function** $f$ from $X$ to $Y$, denoted as $f:X\\rightarrow Y$, is a mapping (think of this as a way to associate or relate or pair) of *each element* of the set $X$ to exactly one of the elements of the set $Y$. To denote elements $x$ and $y$ are paired, we write $x\\mapsto y$. Furthermore, if the element $x$ in $X$ is mapped to the element $y$ in $Y$ by the function $f$, we write $f(x)=y$, and we say that $y$ is the **image of $x$ under $f$**. Besides a way of association, with this definition, we can think of a function $f$ of some kind of machine that accepts an input $x\\in X$ and gives an output $y\\in Y$. \n",

    ">Note:\n",
    ">- *each element* means that every element in $X$ has to be associated to some element in $Y$. However, not every element in $Y$ has to be associated with.\n",
    ">- *exactly one* means that a function is single-valued. It will not give more than one output for the same input.\n",

    "### Example 1\n",
    "Let $X=\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $Y=\\{ 3,5,7,9\\}$. \n",
    "- **(a)** Let $f$ be a way of relating the elements $1,2,3,4$ in $X$ with the elements in $5,3,7,9$ in $Y$ respectively. We write:\n",
    "    - $1 \\mapsto 5$, $2 \\mapsto 3$, $3 \\mapsto 7$, $4 \\mapsto 9$\n",
    "    - $f$ is a function because it fulfills the definition above. \n",
    "- **(b)** Let $g$ be a way of relating the elements $1,2,3,4$ in $X$ with the elements in $3,7,9,7$ in $Y$ respectively. We write:\n",
    "    - $1 \\mapsto 5$, $2 \\mapsto 7$, $3 \\mapsto 9$, $4 \\mapsto 7$\n",
    "    - $g$ is also a function because it fulfills the definition above. \n",

    "For a function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$,:\n",
    "- the set $X$ is called the **domain of $f$**, denoted by $D_{f}$. \n",
    "- The set $Y$ is called the **codomain of $f$**, and\n",
    "- the *set of elements in the set $Y$ with at least one element $x$ in the set $X$ associated to it* is called the **range of $f$**, usually denoted by $R_{f}$. In other words, The range of $f$ is defined as the set of all the possible images of the elements of $X$ under the function $f$ i.e., $R_f =\\{f(x) : x\\in X\\}$.\n",
    "- It is quite obvious from the definition that the range $R_f$ is always a subset of the codomain of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "Referring back to Example 1\n",
    "- **(a)** $D_f={1,2,3,4}$, $R_f={3,5,7,9}$ and $R_f$ is the same as the codomain of $f$.\n",

    "- **(c)** THe terms wouldn't make sense as the relation $h$ is not even a function. In our definition, the concepts of domain, codomain and range only makes sense if the relation is a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a function $f:X\\rightarrow Y$, the precise description of the way to associate element $x\\in X$ with some element $y\\in Y$ is termed the **rule of $f$**. We have seen earlier that if $y$ and $x$ is associated as such, we write $f(x)=y$. Therefore, we can also take that $f(x)$ as the rule of the function $f$. And in A-Level, $f(x)$ is often an expression in the variable $x$. Also, if use the machine anology, we can think of domain of $f$ as the collection of all possible inputs of the function.\n",

    "### Example 3\n",
    "Let $f$ be a function that maps the element $x\\in X=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ with the square of itself $x^2$. Then, we have $x\\mapsto x^2$, or $f(x)$ which is $x^2$, to be the rule of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python, given the domain and rule of $f$, we can use *list comprehension* to get the range of $f$! This is very nice, because this way of doing matches with how we mathematically define $R_f$.\n",

In this representation, the sets are drawn as two different bubbles with the elements inside each set drawn inside the bubbles as well. The association between the elements from the two sets are shown by drawing an arrow between those elements, i.e. if $x\\mapsto y$ or $y=f(x)$, we draw an arrow starting from $x\\in X$ and point to $y\\in Y$.\n",
